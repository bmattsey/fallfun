       <h2> <b>At Mattsey Family Farms we prioritize making our experience enjoyable for all ages!</b></h2>
    <p> From exploring our 10 acre corn maze, to snapping a family photo in our pumpkin patch, there's something for every family.</p>
       <p>Mattsey Family Farms was founded in 1923 when James and Ida Mattsey first settled the area. Since then much has changed as the area has been conditioned for 40 acres of farm land. Soon after purchasing the land the family realized that they could make an experience that the whole surrounding area could enjoy. Thus Mattsey Family Farms was born. In 1953 the farm was officially opened to the public for their enjoyment. Today the farm boasts a petting zoo, pumpkin patch, corn maze, family photography studio, in ground trampoline and so much more. Mattsey Family Farms is an experience that is sure to have you coming back for more!</p>
